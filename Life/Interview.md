**English Version Self-Introduction**

**Good morning, professors.**

My name is He Jianmin, and I’m an undergraduate student majoring in Robotics Engineering at Beihang University. It’s a great honor to be here today. I will introduce myself from two aspects as below.

Academically, my GPA is 90.163, which ranks 5th in my major, and I’ve built a strong foundation in math and physics. I was fortunate to receive the First Prize in the National College Students Mathematics Competition and the Second Prize in the Beijing Physics Competition.

On the practical side, I’ve actively joined robotics competitions and projects. For example, in RoboMaster I worked on the electronic control team, where I developed the dart-launching system and designed power control algorithms for supercapacitors using STM32. This really improved my embedded development and hardware debugging skills. Later, in the RoboCon competition, I was part of the algorithm team for a quadruped robot. I worked on both simulation and real-world debugging, which gave me a deeper understanding of legged robot control and ROS-Gazebo simulation. In addition, I contributed as the second author to a project in the “Feng Ru Cup,” where we explored the use of supercapacitors in UAV energy systems. My role was mainly in control system design and paper writing, which gave me valuable research experience.

Through these experiences, I’ve become confident with tools like STM32, ROS, and SolidWorks, and I’ve also developed problem-solving skills, teamwork, and persistence.

Looking ahead, I hope to continue studying robotics at the graduate level, especially in areas like robot control and perception. I’m really excited about the opportunity to grow further here.

Thank you for your time.

---

#### 🤝 Teamwork & Communication

**Q: Do you prefer working in a team or independently?**

> I enjoy both, and I think each has its advantages. When working independently, I can focus deeply and explore ideas in detail. But I also value teamwork because exchanging perspectives often leads to better solutions. For example, during a robotics project, one teammate suggested a simpler algorithm that I hadn’t considered, which saved us a lot of time. So while I’m comfortable working alone, I prefer a balance, where I can contribute individually but also learn from others.

**Q: Tell me about a time you had a conflict with a teammate. How did you solve it?**

> In one group project, a teammate and I disagreed about how to divide the workload. At first, we both felt the tasks weren’t fair. Instead of continuing to argue, I suggested we write down all the tasks and then assign them based on each person’s strengths and interests. Once we did that, it was clear who was best suited for what, and we quickly reached agreement. That experience taught me that clear communication and focusing on the bigger goal are the best ways to resolve conflicts.

---

#### 💪 Resilience & Failure

**Q: How did you handle pressure or stress?**

> When I feel pressure, I try to break the problem into smaller steps. That makes it easier to focus and prevents me from feeling overwhelmed. I also find physical activity—like playing table tennis—helps me clear my mind and come back with more energy. I believe stress is natural, but with the right mindset and habits, it can actually push me to perform better.

**Q: Tell me about a time you failed.**

> In my early research work, I once miscalibrated a robotic arm and ended up collecting several hours of data that turned out to be useless. At first, I felt frustrated, but instead of giving up, I documented what went wrong and created a checklist for calibration steps. After that, I never repeated the same mistake. That failure was disappointing, but it taught me that errors are valuable learning opportunities, and systematic habits can prevent them in the future.

**Q: Describe a challenge you faced and how you overcame it.**

> During my thesis project, I faced a challenge where the robot wasn’t responding as expected during experiments. Since the deadline was close, it was stressful. To solve it, I carefully tested each component separately—hardware, software, and wiring. Eventually, I found a wiring issue that caused the error. Breaking the problem down step by step was what helped me overcome the challenge. It also gave me more confidence to deal with unexpected problems in future research.

**Q: If you encounter difficulties in your future research life, how will you deal with them?**

> First, I’ll analyze the problem carefully myself and try different approaches. If I still can’t solve it, I won’t hesitate to seek advice from professors or peers, since fresh perspectives are often very helpful. I’ll also remind myself that difficulties are a normal part of research—patience and persistence are key. My goal would be to treat challenges not as setbacks, but as part of the learning process.
